# TPC Content Hubs

This repo contains the official implementation of TPC Content Hubs.

## What are TPC Content Hubs?

They are servers whose primary goal is to store user-made content.
Since this is also designed to be used by other Cell Machine remakes, everything also has a tag saying for what its designed for.

# What are the tags?

Here are the tags TPC itself will use to render a badge:

- tpc (The Puzzle Cell)
- cellua (CelLua Machine)
- jell (Jell Machine)
- kell (Kell Machine)
- quell (Quell Machine)
- poly (PolyMachine)
- modular (ModularCM)
- celspeed (CelSpeed)
- cmmm (Cell Machine Mystic Mod)
- cmmmp (Cell Machine Mystic Mod Plus)
- cmmmpmm (Cell Machine Mystic Mod Plus Milenakos Mod)

> Note: This does not mean these remakes and mods have confirmed that they will support TPC Content Hubs.
